# Game engine for Chicken Scheme
10 April 2018

I've always loved Scheme for it's elegancy and expressiveness. But always considered it to be a toy language as it did not have any practical use for me. It seemed to academical to be practical for me.

That is until I learned about [Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/). The great thing about this implementation is that is compiles Scheme to pure C. Because if this it is possible to use any C library without effort and, with a just a little effort, C++ libraries.

In my spare time I've been working, one-and-of, on my own game called _Grimmol_. It is written purely in Chicken Scheme including the 2D game engine called _Coati_. I released it under a MIT license and you can find it [here](https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d).

Coati is a simple to use fast 2D game programming library for Chicken Scheme. Most of the things needed in other to write a 2D game are implemented. I clean Scheme like way to handle sound is coming but in the mean time you can use [SDL mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/).

To get started using Coati make sure Chicken Scheme is installed along with the following libraries:

* sdl-base
* sdl-ttf
* opengl-glew
* gl-utils
* gl-math
* soil
* matchable

Then install the needed Chicken _Eggs_ ...

	chicken-install -s sdl-base sdl-ttf opengl-glew gl-utils gl-math soil matchable
	
... clone and install Coati ...

	git clone https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d.git
	cd coati-2d
	chicken-install -s
	
... and try out some samples ...

	cd examples/
	csi 01.scm
	csi 02.scm
	
The tutorial to get started can be found [here](https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d/blob/master/TUTORIAL.org).

I hope that this library can give somebody a fun introduction to the wunderful world of Scheme!
