<h1>Better than Google</h1>

<p>11 April 2018</p>

<p>Once I tried to search something on Google via my sisters computer and by accident found out she searched something in the line of “Google, can I see some pictures of Cats?”. I tried to search for it myself, it did not return that many pictures of cats. Nowadays it does. Google has been <em>improving</em> it’s search engine not to look at what you are literally searching for but what it, thinks, you are looking for. This is all good and well if you want to indulgence in cute pictures of the species Felis Catus but if you are looking for something more obscure or specific searching for something becomes nigh on impossible.</p>

<p>I’ve pried myself in the past for my Google-fu but trough the years as Google continued to <em>improve</em> for there customers (the advertisers, not you) all my skills become lost and I cannot find anything on Google anymore if it isn’t some recipe on a popular side or a review of a popular movie on another biased site.</p>

<p>That is why I decided to stop using Google and start using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. Actually, I made this decision every year for the past 5 years but always came back. First the search results of DuckDuckGo where not that great, then they where good but not as good as Google’s. But now, after using it for more than 4 months I must say, to me, the results are better then those of Google.</p>

<p>The fact that DuckDuckGo does not track you or pollute it’s search results for paid-for items is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>If anybody was thinking of using DuckDuckGo I think now is a good time.</p>

<h1>Game engine for Chicken Scheme</h1>

<p>10 April 2018</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved Scheme for it&rsquo;s elegancy and expressiveness. But always considered it to be a toy language as it did not have any practical use for me. It seemed to academical to be practical for me.</p>

<p>That is until I learned about <a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>. The great thing about this implementation is that it compiles Scheme to pure C. Because of this it is possible to use any C library without effort and, with a just a little effort, C++ libraries.</p>

<p>In my spare time I&rsquo;ve been working, one-and-of, on my own game called <em>Grimmol</em>. It is written purely in Chicken Scheme including the 2D game engine called <em>Coati</em>. I released it under a MIT license and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Coati is a simple to use fast 2D game programming library for Chicken Scheme. Most of the things needed in order to write a 2D game are implemented. A clean Scheme-like way to handle sound is coming but in the mean time you can use <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL mixer</a>.</p>

<p>To get started using Coati make sure Chicken Scheme is installed along with the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>sdl-base</li>
<li>sdl-ttf</li>
<li>opengl-glew</li>
<li>gl-utils</li>
<li>gl-math</li>
<li>soil</li>
<li>matchable</li>
</ul>


<p>Then install the needed Chicken <em>Eggs</em> &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>chicken-install -s sdl-base sdl-ttf opengl-glew gl-utils gl-math soil matchable
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; clone and install Coati &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d.git
cd coati-2d
chicken-install -s
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and try out some samples &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>cd examples/
csi 01.scm
csi 02.scm
</code></pre>

<p>The tutorial to get started can be found <a href="https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d/blob/master/TUTORIAL.org">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that this library can give somebody a fun introduction to the wunderful world of Scheme!</p>

<h1>Extremely simple blogging engine</h1>

<p>04 April 2018</p>

<p>I finally decided to start my own blog&hellip;</p>

<p>It took me a while to get started because I wanted to have a perfectly tailored blogging engine. Options like Wordpress were of the table because I wanted my blog to remain simple and static. Jekyll would be a good option but I wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in learning Ruby. Also my needs are very simple. I just need a list of articles and a navigation bar to those items. The rest I will handle with .css and optionally JavaScript. So, against better advice I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>The end result turned out to be, very, very simplistic. As in, brutalistic simplistic here is the entire &lsquo;engine&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# all articles by creation time
articles=`ls -tU articles/*.md`

# return the title an article
function title() {
    head -n 1 $1 | cut -c 3-
}

# place to header of the page
cat pre.html

# place links to articles
echo "&lt;nav&gt;&lt;ul&gt;"
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#${title// /-}\"&gt;$title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"
done;
echo "&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;"

# place articles
echo "&lt;section&gt;"
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "&lt;article id=\"${title// /-}\"&gt;"
    markdown $filename
    echo "&lt;/article&gt;"
done;
echo "&lt;/section&gt;"

# place the footer of the page
cat post.html
</code></pre>

<p>The engine sorts all markdown files in a directory called <em>articles</em> converts them to html and sandwiches it between a html header and footer. That is all, the rest is handled by <em>.css</em>. No JavaScript is needed at the moment though I might enrich the functionality of this blog in the future with it.</p>

<p>This is how the <em>markdown</em> for one of my <a href="#Demo-post">posts</a> looks like:</p>

<pre><code># Demo post
