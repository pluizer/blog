<h1>Game engine for Chicken Scheme</h1>

<p>10 April 2018</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved Scheme for it&rsquo;s elegancy and expressiveness. But always considered it to be a toy language as it did not have any practical use for me. It seemed to academical to be practical for me.</p>

<p>That is until I learned about <a href="https://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>. The great thing about this implementation is that is compiles Scheme to pure C. Because if this it is possible to use any C library without effort and, with a just a little effort, C++ libraries.</p>

<p>In my spare time I&rsquo;ve been working, one-and-of, on my own game called /Grimmol/. It is written purely in Chicken Scheme including the 2D game engine called /Coati/. I released it under a MIT license and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Coati is a simple to use fast 2D game programming library for Chicken Scheme. Most of the things needed in other to write a 2D game are implemented. I clean Scheme like way to handle sound is coming but in the mean time you can use <a href="Sound%20is%20comming%20but%20you%20can%20use%20the%20SDL">SDL mixer</a>.</p>

<p>To get started using Coati make sure Chicken Scheme is installed along with the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>sdl-base</li>
<li>sdl-ttf</li>
<li>opengl-glew</li>
<li>gl-utils</li>
<li>gl-math</li>
<li>soil</li>
<li>matchable</li>
</ul>


<p>Then install the needed Chicken /Eggs/ &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>chicken-install -s sdl-base sdl-ttf opengl-glew gl-utils gl-math soil matchable
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; clone and install Coati &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d.git
cd coati-2d
chicken-install -s
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and try out some samples &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>cd examples/
csi 01.scm
csi 02.scm
</code></pre>

<p>The tutorial to get started can be found <a href="https://github.com/pluizer/coati-2d/blob/master/TUTORIAL.org">here</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that this library can give somebody a fun introduction to the wunderful world of Scheme!</p>

<h1>Extremely simple blogging engine</h1>

<p>04 April 2018</p>

<p>I finally decided to start my own blog&hellip;</p>

<p>It took me a while to get started because I wanted to have a perfectly tailored blogging engine. Options like Wordpress were of the table because I wanted my blog to remain simple and static. Jekyll would be a good option but I wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in learning Ruby. Also my needs are very simple. I just need a list of articles and a navigation bar to those items. The rest I will handle with .css and optionally JavaScript. So, against better advice I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>The end result turned out to be, very, very simplistic. As in, brutalistic simplistic here is the entire &lsquo;engine&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# all articles by creation time
articles=`ls -tU articles/*.md`

# return the title an article
function title() {
    head -n 1 $1 | cut -c 3-
}

# place to header of the page
cat pre.html

# place links to articles
echo "&lt;nav&gt;&lt;ul&gt;"
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#${title// /-}\"&gt;$title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"
done;
echo "&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;"

# place articles
echo "&lt;section&gt;"
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "&lt;article id=\"${title// /-}\"&gt;"
    markdown $filename
    echo "&lt;/article&gt;"
done;
echo "&lt;/section&gt;"

# place the footer of the page
cat post.html
</code></pre>

<p>The engine sorts all markdown files in a directory called <em>articles</em> converts them to html and sandwiches it between a html header and footer. That is all, the rest is handled by <em>.css</em>. No JavaScript is needed at the moment though I might enrich the functionality of this blog in the future with it.</p>

<p>This is how the <em>markdown</em> for one of my <a href="#Demo-post">posts</a> looks like:</p>

<pre><code># Demo post
