<h1>Extremely simple blogging engine</h1>

<p>04 April 2018</p>

<p>I finally decided to start my own blog&hellip;</p>

<p>It took me a while to get started because I wanted to have a perfectly tailored blogging engine. Options like Wordpress were of the table because I wanted my blog to remain simple and static. Jekyll would be a good option but I wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in learning Ruby. Also my needs are very simple. I just need a list of articles and a navigation bar to those items. The rest I will handle with .css and optionally JavaScript. So, against better advice I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>The end result turned out to be, very, very simplistic. As in, brutalistic simplistic here is the entire &lsquo;engine&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# all articles by date
articles=`ls -t articles/*.md`

# return the title an article
function title() {
    head -n 1 $1 | cut -c 3-
}

# place to header of the page
cat pre.html

# place links to articles
echo "&lt;nav&gt;&lt;ul&gt;"
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#${title// /-}\"&gt;$title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"
done;
echo "&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;"

# place articles
for filename in $articles; do
    title=`title $filename`
    echo "&lt;a name=\"${title// /-}\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"
    echo "&lt;section&gt;&lt;article&gt;"
    markdown $filename
    echo "&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"
done;

# place the footer of the page
cat post.html
</code></pre>

<p>The engine sorts all markdown files in a directory called <em>articles</em> converts them to html a sandwiches it between a html header and footer. That is all, the rest is handled by <em>.css</em>. No JavaScript is needed at the moment though I might enrich the functionality of this blog in the future with it.</p>
